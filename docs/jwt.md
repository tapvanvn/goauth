Notes: 
- about renew machanism: in traditional, it's common to issue a short unique, onetime renew token to revoke a new jwt. But if attacker can stole the jwt what prevent him to do the same with the renew token. So seprate to 2 token is messing. I try to issue all jwts of a account base on unique short token. once client call renew from one of these jwts, the short token correspond to account will be change and all the others would be invalid. If the attacker stoles the jwt and call renew using that stolen jwt, the owner of account cannot be access and he must be login using the main method, this will issue a new short token and also make the stolen jwt be invalid.
